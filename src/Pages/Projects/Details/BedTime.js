### Before we dive in
The goal of this tutorial is to get you familiar with writing composable software. At the same time, manage statefulness. Almost every application we write will have end users triggering all sorts of events sending us different inputs to process and output back.  

I/O [(input/output)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output) is inherently impure. But, I/O can still be *pure*, if the passing of data is explicit as both an argument and a result and the I/O operations fail when the conditions we write aren't explicitly met.

In order for state to change things have to mutate. Mutations or state changes cause [side-effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)). What the functional paradigm will allow us to do is isolate our side-effects and easily note discrepencies in stateful code.

Here's an example of what I mean when I say composability and first-class functions. Notice how composable or *expressive* the code is inside the function body of \`getWakeUpTimes\`.  

~~~typescript
const getWakeUpTimes = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    
    const elems = getElements();

    const { hour, minute, period } = elems;

    const errors = isEmpty(hour, minute, period);

    const sleepCycles = getSleepCycles(hour, minute);

    const copy = sleepCycles.map(sleepCycle => new Date(sleepCycle.getTime()));

    if (period === 'PM') {
        subtractTwelveHours(period, copy);
    };

    if (hours === '12') {
        addTwelveHours(hour, copy);
    };

    render(errors, toTwelveHourTimeString(copy));
};
~~~

It's comprised of smaller, more modular, functions. With a single responsibility. Assigning variables to functions to be passed as input.  

This code is impure, mind you. It changes the state of the document object model (DOM) and that's a side-effect. But, we can isolate our side-effects, test, and debug them much much easier than having one long function body with many stateful operations. 

#### Let's begin
Create a form with \`id="calculate\`. Inside the form create \`select\` elements for hours, minute, and period (AM and PM)
Give each select element give an \`id\` to identify the hour, minute, and period
At the end of the form create a \`button\` element of \`type="submit\` for when we submit our form.
Now let's add some JavaScript to make it dynamic.

        <select id="period">

            <option value="AM">AM</option>
            <option value="PM">PM</option>
        </select>
        <button type="submit">Calculate</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
~~~

#### Write a callback function to fire on submit event
Declare a variable \`getWakeUpTimes(e)\` and assign it to a function. Pass an \`event\` parameter 
and call \`event.preventDefault()\` to disable the default submission behavior.

~~~javascript
const getWakeUpTimes = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
};
~~~~

Next declare a variable \`form\` and assign it to our form. Then call \`addEventListener\` 
and on submit fire our callback function \`getWakeUpTimes\`.

~~~javascript
const form = document.querySelector('form#calculate');
form.addEventListener('submit', getWakeUpTimes);
~~~~

It wont do anything, yet. Let's create a function to get our values.

#### Write a function to grab the select DOM nodes and return their values
Assign four variables \`results\`, \`selectHours\`, \`selectMinutes\`, \`selectPeriod\` with \`document.querySelector()\` to reference the DOM nodes we'll interact with.
Return an object containing the \`hour\`, \`minute\`, and \`period\` variables.  

~~~javascript
const getElements = () => {
    const selectHours = document.querySelector('select#hour');
    const selectMinutes = document.querySelector('select#minute');
    const selectPeriod = document.querySelector('select#period');

    const hour = selectHours.value;
    const minute = selectMinutes.value;
    const period = selectPeriod.value;

    return { hour, minute, period };
};
~~~

Remember our \`getWakeUpTimes\` function we created? Let's declare a variable \`elems\` insdie the function body and set it to our function. 
Since our function returns an object we can destructure our values \`{ hours, minutes, period }\` and use them as their variable names. 
When we log the object out to the console we can omit the object's key name if it's the same name as the property.

~~~javascript
const getWakeUpTimes = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const elems = getElements();

    const { hour, minute, period } = elems;

    console.log({ hour, minute, period });
};
~~~

Now our form will log out our values! Let's go furthur.

#### Get our sleep cycles  
So, let's think. What do we need to do when they submit the form? Whether it's pseudo-code or just some notes to think the logic through, it's always good to step back and think before coding.  

When the user submit's their time from the form, instantiate a \`Date\` with \`new Date()\` and set the time back 9 hours, 7 hours and 30 minutes, 6 hours, 4 hours and 30 minutes to account for the sleep cycles. Declare a variable \`getSleepCycles(hour, minute)\`. Our function takes two parameters, hour and minute.

Return an array so we can use \`Array\` methods later.
~~~javascript
const getSleepCycles = (hour, minute) => {
    const firstCycle = new Date(null, null, null, hour - 9, minute);
    const secondCycle = new Date(null, null, null, hour - 7, minute - 30);
    const thirdCycle = new Date(null, null, null, hour - 6, minute);
    const fourthCycle = new Date(null, null, null, hour - 4, minute - 30);

    return [firstCycle, secondCycle, thirdCycle, fourthCycle];
};
~~~

Now let's place this function after our \`hour\`, \`minute\`, and \`period\` variables. 
Make sure you create a copy of the array and not mutate the original. 
A common pattern in JavaScript, in particular React, is to see is \`[...sleepCycles]\` or \`{ ...sleepCycle }\`.  

This is a way to create a copy of an array or object with \`...\` spread syntax. 
In our case we have an instance of \`Date\`. From my testing, setting a variable to \`[...sleepCycles]\` and mutating it will still mutate the original array. 
We have to map over our array and for each callback return a \`new Date()\`. This gives us a new copied array populated with the values we need that doesn't mutate.

~~~javascript
const getWakeUpTimes = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const elems = getElements();

    const { hour, minute, period } = elems;

    const sleepCycles = getSleepCycles(hour, minute);

    const copy = sleepCycles.map(sleepCycle => new Date(sleepCycle.getTime()));

    console.log(copy);
};
~~~

In the console you'll get back an array of \`Date\` instances with the sleep cycles!

Uh oh... We got a bug. Try submitting the same hour and minutes for AM and PM. The output is the same. How can we fix that? Take a minute to think about it logically. Try implementing a solution before you go on.
This will be a large part of your job as a developer. Problem solving, pseudo-code, and thinking through the problem before you write code.
#### Handle AM and PM
Hopefully you were able to find a solution. Let me explain my thought process and break it down. 
When we set the period to PM we're not accounting for our \`Date\` instance being 24 hour time. 
At the moment our form only submits 00:00 to 12:00 (12:00 AM to 12:00 PM). 
Add an \`if\` statement inside \`getTimesToWakeUp\` to check if our \`period\` variable is AM or PM. 

~~~javascript
const getWakeUpTimes = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const elems = getElements();

    const { hour, minute, period } = elems;

    const sleepCycles = getSleepCycles(hour, minute);

    const copy = sleepCycles.map(sleepCycle => new Date(sleepCycle.getTime()));

    if (period === 'PM') {
        subtractTwelveHours(copy);
    };

    console.log(copy);
};
~~~

If the period is PM then subtract 12 hours from each \`Date\`.
Now we can submit from 12:00 to 24:00 (12:00 PM to 12:00 AM)!  

Let's assign a variable to a function \`subtractTwelveHours\` to handle the PM logic. 

~~~javascript
const subtractTwelveHours = (sleepCyclesArr) => {
    return sleepCyclesArr.map(sleepCycleObject => {
        return sleepCycleObject.setHours(sleepCycleObject.getHours() - 12);
    });
};
~~~

We can simply map over each object return the objects hours with \`setHours()\` passing our objects hours with \`getHours()\`.  

#### Adjust for AM to PM switch when hour is 12
Well... We have another bug to squash, but that's the life of a programmer.
When you submit the form with the hour being a value of 12 it's not accounting for the the switch from AM to PM. 
We need to add 12 hours to adjust for the change from AM to PM.
Add an \`if\` statement to check if the value was 12. 

~~~javascript
const getWakeUpTimes = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const elems = getElements();

    const { hour, minute, period } = elems;

    const sleepCycles = getSleepCycles(hour, minute);

    const copy = sleepCycles.map(sleepCycle => new Date(sleepCycle.getTime()));

    if (period === 'PM') {
        subtractTwelveHours(copy);
    };

    if (hours === '12') {
        addTwelveHours(copy);
    };

    console.log(copy);
};
~~~

Now to create the function to handle the logic. Assign another variable \`addTwelveHours\` to a function. 
Again, use the \`map\` method to set the hours \`setHours()\` of our object by passing in the objects hours with \`getHours()\`. This time, adding 12 hours.

~~~javascript
const addTwelveHours = (sleepCyclesArr) => {
    return sleepCyclesArr.map(sleepCycleObject => {
        return sleepCycleObject.setHours(sleepCycleObject.getHours() + 12);
    });
};
~~~

#### Handle form validation.
We don't want the user submitting a form with an empty value. 
Assign a variable \`isEmpty()\` to a function with parameters hour, minute, and period. 
Declare an errors variable and set it to the element with the \`id\` of errors using \`querySelector\`. You can use \`getElementById\` as well. I only used \`querySelector\` to play with it.
Write an \`if\` statement to check the strict equality \`===\` of each argument value. 
In an application that handles sensitive data you'd typically have more rigid form validation.  

~~~javascript
const isEmpty = (hour, minute, period) => {
    const errors = document.querySelector('div#errors');
    if (hour === '' || minute === '' || period === '') {
        errors.textContent = 'You must fill in the fields.';
        errors.setAttribute('class', 'error');
        return true;
    };
    errors.textContent = '';
    return false;
};
~~~

If the text fields are empty the \`textContent\` property of our elements errors variable is set to a string: 'You must enter the fields.'
On the errors element call \`setAttribute\`. The first argument is the attribute name. In our case, a class. The second argument the value we want to set it to. A css class.
Now call \`return true\` because our form is empty.
If the parameters pass our conditional then we'll just set the errors \`textContent\` property to an empty string.
Return false because our form is not empty.
Here's the updated \`getWakeUpTimes\` function.

You can now add \`isErrors\` to our \`getWakeUpTimes\` function.

~~~javascript
const getWakeUpTimes = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const elems = getElements();

    const { hour, minute, period } = elems;

    const isErrors = isEmpty(hour, minute, period);

    const sleepCycles = getSleepCycles(hour, minute);

    const copy = sleepCycles.map(sleepCycle => new Date(sleepCycle.getTime()));

    if (period === 'PM') {
        subtractTwelveHours(copy);
    };

    if (hour === '12') {
        addTwelveHours(copy);
    };
};
~~~

Let's move on and format the date before we render.

#### Set our date object to en-US 12-hour time with AM/PM

Now assign a variable to a function \`toTwelveHourTime()\` to set our array sleep cycles to en-US. 
It will take one parameter, our array of sleep cycles. 
Declare a variable \`options\` as an object with three properties \`hour\`, \`minute\`, and \`hour12\`. 
We'll pass this object to the method\`toLocaleTimeString\`.

Call the map method on our sleep cycles array and return. In the map callback return each each object calling \`toLocaleTimeString\` and pass in a string \`'en-US'\` as the first parameter to specify our [locale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_software)). 
The second parameter will be an our \`options\` object describing how to output the time. [There are several options to configure.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleTimeString).
~~~javascript
const toTwelveHourTime = (sleepCyclesArr) => {
    const options = { 
        hour: 'numeric',
        minute: 'numeric',
        hour12: 'true'
    }
    return sleepCyclesArr.map(sleepCyclesObj => {
        return sleepCyclesObj.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', options);
    });
};
~~~

Now we can use it to wrap our \`copy\` of sleep cycles and return a more human readable time.

~~~javascript
const getWakeUpTimes = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const elems = getElements();

    const { hour, minute, period } = elems;

    const isErrors = isEmpty(hour, minute, period);

    const sleepCycles = getSleepCycles(hour, minute);

    const copy = sleepCycles.map(sleepCycle => new Date(sleepCycle.getTime()));

    if (period === 'PM') {
        subtractTwelveHours(copy);
    };

    if (hour === '12') {
        addTwelveHours(copy);
    };

    toTwelveHourTime(copy);
};
~~~

Lastly, it's time to create the \`render\` function.

#### Rendering the sleep cycles or errors
Assign a variable \`results\` to the div DOM node with the id of results.
Declare a variable \`render\` and assign it to a function. 
This function will return a ternary.
Either A string of HTML or an empty string depending on the value of \`isErrors\`.
Our sleep cycles are in an array so we can grab their index and embed them in the HTML. 

Hopefully now you can see why React is so popular. In plain JavaScript manipulating the DOM 
is tedious. Lots of \`createElement\`, \`appendChild\`, \`textContent\`, \`innerHTML\`, \`insertAdjacentHTML\`, \`setAttribute\`, etc. 
Instead with React we could return JSX. In my opinion our UI's are so tightly coupled to JavaScript it makes sense. I'm returning 
HTML as a string here. Why not return it with syntax highlighting and extended features? (If you can't tell I love React.)

~~~javascript
const render = (isErrors, sleepCycles) => {
    const results = document.querySelector('div#results');

    return !isErrors ? results.innerHTML = 
    \`
        You should go to bed at:
        <div>
        \${sleepCycles[0]}<span>, or</span>
        \${sleepCycles[1]}<span>, or</span>
        \${sleepCycles[2]}<span>, or</span>
        \${sleepCycles[3]}
        </div>
    \` : results.textContent = '';
};
~~~

Finally, let's add our \`render\` function to \`getWakeUpTimes\`.

~~~javascript
const getWakeUpTimes = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const elems = getElements();

    const { hour, minute, period } = elems;

    const isErrors = isEmpty(hour, minute, period);

    const sleepCycles = getSleepCycles(hour, minute);

    if (period === 'PM') {
        subtractTwelveHours(sleepCycles);
    };

    if (hour === '12') {
        addTwelveHours(sleepCycles);
    };

    render(isErrors, toTwelveHourTime(sleepCycles));
};
~~~
